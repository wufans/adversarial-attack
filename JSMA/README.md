Code for the  paper [The Limitations of Deep Learning in Adversarial Settings](http://xueshu.baidu.com/s?wd=paperuri%3A%2859d5f27d294c6fe95b89ffa3e3360cff%29&filter=sc_long_sign&tn=SE_xueshusource_2kduw22v&sc_vurl=http%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F1511.07528&ie=utf-8&sc_us=5191860372632183026).

You need to install [cleverhans](https://github.com/tensorflow/cleverhans) as a dependency to run this source code.
```python
python3 mnist_jsma.py
```

And thanks to the work of [gongzhitaao](https://github.com/gongzhitaao/tensorflow-adversarial), we implement this algorithms with tensorflow, and get statistics results in mnist dataset.
```
 python jsma_mnist_10x10.py 
```
